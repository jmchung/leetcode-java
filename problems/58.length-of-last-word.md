# 58. Length of Last Word

Given a stringsconsists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters`' '`, return the length of last word in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

**Note: **A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

For example,  
Given _s_=`"Hello World"`,  
return`5`.

# Thought

Assume that the \_ is space. i represents the position of the last character in sequence. Keep moving i to LEFT until meet the alphabets \(last word\), then start counting.

```
          v ← i
Hello_World____
```

# Solution

```java
public class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        int res = 0, i = s.length() - 1;
        while (i >= 0 && s.charAt(i) == ' ') i--;
        while (i >= 0 && s.charAt(i) != ' ') {
            i--;
            res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
