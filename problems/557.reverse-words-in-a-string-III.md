# 557. Reverse Words in a String III

Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
```

**Note: **In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.

# Thought

Split the given string by space, for each item we traverse the word from both sides to exchange the letter. Finally join the reversed-words with space.

# Solution

```java
public class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            // reverse the current string
            char[] c = words[i].toCharArray();
            int l = 0, r = c.length - 1;
            while (l < r) {
                char temp = c[l];
                c[l++] = c[r];
                c[r--] = temp;
            }
            words[i] = String.valueOf(c);
        }

        return String.join(" ", words);
    }
}
```
