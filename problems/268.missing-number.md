# 268. Missing Number

Given an array containingndistinct numbers taken from`0, 1, 2, ..., n`, find the one that is missing from the array.

For example,  
Givennums=`[0, 1, 3]`return`2`.

**Note**:  
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

XOR

OP1    OP2    RES
0      0      0
0      1      1
1      0      1
1      1      0

e.g.,

    1    1    0    1
 ^  1    1    0    0
    ----------------
    0    0    0    1

# Solution

REF. [4 Line Simple Java Bit Manipulate Solution with Explaination](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/24535/4-line-simple-java-bit-manipulate-solution-with-explaination) by [mo10](https://discuss.leetcode.com/user/mo10)

> The basic idea is to use XOR operation. We all know that **a^b^b =a**,** which means two xor operations with the same number will eliminate the number and reveal the original number**.
>
> In this solution, I apply XOR operation to both the index and value of the array. In a complete array with no missing numbers, the index and value should be perfectly corresponding\( nums\[index\] = index\), so in a missing array, what left finally is the missing number.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int xor = 0, i;
        for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            xor = xor ^ i ^ nums[i];
        }

        return xor ^ i;
    }
}
```
