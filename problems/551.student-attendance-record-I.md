# 551. Student Attendance Record I

You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:

1. **'A'**: Absent.
2. **'L'**: Late.
3. **'P'**: Present.

A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain **more than one 'A' \(absent\) **or **more than two continuous 'L' \(late\)**.

You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his attendance record.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "PPALLP"
Output: True
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "PPALLL"
Output: False
```

# Solution

REF. [Oleksandr Pyrohov](https://discuss.leetcode.com/user/oleksandr-pyrohov)'s [One line Java solution without Regex](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/86571/one-line-java-solution-without-regex)

> I'm using two simple checks:
>
> * String doesn't contains`LLL`.
> * The first occurrence of`A`is equals to the last occurrence of`A`.

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean checkRecord(String s) {
       return !s.contains("LLL") && (s.indexOf("A") == s.lastIndexOf("A"));
    }
}
```

Since the pattern is determined, an alternative is regular expression like [compton\_scatter](https://discuss.leetcode.com/user/compton_scatter)'s [solution](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/86466/java-1-liner/3),

```java
public boolean checkRecord(String s) {
    return !s.matches(".*LLL.*|.*A.*A.*");
}
```
